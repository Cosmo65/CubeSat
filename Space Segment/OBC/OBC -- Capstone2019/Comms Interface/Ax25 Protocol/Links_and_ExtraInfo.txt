Ax.25 Protocol

HDLC- High Level Data Link Control 
http://vkalra.tripod.com/hdlc.html
-> Thinking that we are operating in normal response mode 
-> FCS is important for detecting bit errors. This will directly influence transmission.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Data_Link_Control
-> Wiki is also good to understand the protocol 


**Note**
-> We are running in half duplex, normal mode, and no network protocol is going to be implemented (also endurosat does not support network layer capabilities)
