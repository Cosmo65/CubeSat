2 cells in series, and two series in parallel (ask Endurosat about this).

Referring to the terminal diagram, the negative terminals and and the anode may be connected together,
and connected to the positive terminal (bottom-side) of another cell. The cathode of the bypass diode connects
to the underside (positive) of the cell.

The circuit connects to a 4-pin MOLEX connector (2 negative, 2 positive for redundancy).
