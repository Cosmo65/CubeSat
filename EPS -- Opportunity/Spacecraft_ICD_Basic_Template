Basic Spacecraft Interface Control Document

INTERFACE: EPS Opportunity

MECHANICAL INTERFACES:
-- SUBSYSTEM: Structure

Solar panels mounted to the outside surfaces of the long sides of the CubeSat (along x,y axes). Panels mounted via corner screws.
Temperature range: -40 to +85 Celcius
Mass: 100-160g

EPS board mounted in stacked formation with corner screws (most likely)
Temperature range: -40 to +85 Celcius
Mass: 80-200g

Batteries mounted with board (most likely)
Temperature range: -40 to +85 Celcius
Mass: 100-200g

-- MECHANICAL Opportunity

%% Here, the mechanical team acknowledges the interface / requests specific information / highlights any conflicts. In the case of the ADCS or OBDH subsystem, BOTH mechanical teams must acknowledge the interface.

ELECTRICAL INTERFACES:
-- SUBSYSTEM: ADCS, OBDH, Communication, Payload

Providing power to all components during entire orbit period either from solar panels, batteries or both.

-- EPS Opportunity

DATA INTERFACES:
-- SUBSYSTEM: OBDH

Sending sensor data on voltage, current and temperature levels as well as battery charge levels.

-- OBDH: Opportunity

%% Here, the onboard computer team acknowledges the interface / requests specific information / highlights any conflicts.
